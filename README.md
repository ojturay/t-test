# t-test
Problem
Hospital pathology departments routinely analyse blood samples.
Ideally, collected samples are analysed immediately, but sometimes the samples need to be stored overnight and analysed the next day.
A study was undertaken to assess whether there are any differences in the blood test results between these two procedures.
Specifically, nine blood samples were collected on a single day. 
Each sample was split into two equal parts, with the first part being analysed immediately and the second part being cooled and analysed the next day. 
The measurement of interest is the hormone NT-proBNP. The measured hormone levels for the samples (in Âµmol/L) are given in Table 1.
A consulting statistician took these data, performed a paired t-test, 
and found no significant difference between the expected NT-proBNP levels when analysed immediately versus when they were cooled. 
This was a surprising result, since the pathologists in the department believed that storing the blood samples would lead to a deterioration. 
They ask you to analyse the data again to check whether the statistician could have made a mistake,
which you can do either by hand or by using any software that you feel comfortable using. 
Who is correct? The statistician or the pathologists?
